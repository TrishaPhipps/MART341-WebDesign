Project Overview

I worked on my: index.html from my Instructable

Required Techniques

    Created a page with an external CSS style sheet: I'm continuing my PC building instructable from last week, working on the index.html page.
    Added hover effects to enhance interactivity: 
    Used an external font that is self-hosted: downloaded Jost font from Google Fonts
    Used an external font from a font library: Sourced Montseratt font family from Google Fonts

Additional Techniques

    Experiment with different font styles: Made the body text bolder 
    Used text-shadow to enhance font prominence: I applied a text-shadow to the body 
    Used text-decoration to add underlines: I added an underline to my links as a hover effect for emphasis.
    Adjusted spacing for readability: I increased the letter-spacing of my headers and paragrpahs to make it more readable
    Aligned text or elements for a clean layout: I used center alignment throughout the site
