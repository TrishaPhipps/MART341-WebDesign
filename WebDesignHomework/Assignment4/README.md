A web browser is a software that allows users to access and view content on the web. The user will use the browswer 

to enter the website address, and the browser (behind the scenes) will send a request, or **HTTP(S) protocol**

to the server where the website's files are stored. Once the server receives the request, it will send back the website's

files. The site's files are written in a language such as HTML, CSS, or Javascript, and the browser's job

is to interpret those files and display them for the user. 


The **Document Object Model** creates a structure for the language the webpage is written in. 

**HTML** is the *original* language of the web. HTML uses some tags that need to be closed, and others that do not. 

**XML** always needs closed tags. XML has a special syntax for tags, and was created as a way of not having to use the

fixed vocabulary of HTML. 

**XHTML** is a reformation of HTML using the syntax of XML.


Four elements every HTML page needs:
- DOCTYPE
- HTML
- `<head></head>`
- `<body></body>`

index.html serves as the is the homepage of the webiste and is placed in the root directory of the server's directory structure. 

Naming practices for clean and organized code:
- names should be descriptive and unambiguous
- use meaningful distinctions
- should be pronouncable and searchable
-
