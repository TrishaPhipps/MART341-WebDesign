<h1>About My Website Ideas</h1>

<hr />

<h3>Business website re-design</h3>
    <p>I like this idea because it gives me an opportunity to use some web dev skills and re-work this website into something more professional.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Personal Journal</h3>
    <p>This idea would be fun as a way to create a blog-style site for my own personal experiences.</p>

<hr />

<h3>My dog fan-page</h3>
    <p>This would just a be a fun site full of everything about my dog.</p>
