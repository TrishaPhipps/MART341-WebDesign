I used divs to also section off the bottom portion of my website to insert the iframe. 

## Span (at least 2):

I used a span tag to highlight certain words to convey my theme. 
I used another span to highlight my copyright in the footer.

## Iframe (at least 1):

I used an iframe to embed an external map to a local art space.

## Class (at least 2):

I used the class media-item to structure the layout of the audio and timer sections, applying the same styles for spacing and alignment.

I used the &copy; escape character to display the copyright symbol (Â©) in the footer of the webpage, providing a legal symbol without using a special character.
