I am chosing to create a site for personal journaling, and to document progress on goals that I create for myself. 

I can use this site as a **vision board** for my ideas.

I would like to create a less text-heavy site, and one that is more focused on images.

This site is not balanced or layed out how I envisioned. I am familiar with using divs and external style sheets to create all of the styling.

I honestly might change my website idea as we get further in this class with learning.
